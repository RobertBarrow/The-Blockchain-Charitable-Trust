### BRAINSTEAM

A backronym developed for Lean startups[1], which can be easily adapted and used by any group developing an idea e.g. in a brainstorming session.


**B** is for the “**Business opportunity**”. _(This can be swapped for “Basic premise” (e.g. for NPOs) or “Business requirement” in an Agile environment)_

**R** is for any “**Risks**” that are to be managed or mitigated. _(Planned for, insured against, avoided etc.)_

**A** is for any “**Assumptions**” that are to be tested.

**I** is for any “**Impediments**” that need to be removed _(or predicted ones that can be avoided)_.

**N** is for “**Nudges**” that can influence behaviour. _(See "Nudge theory" for more detail)_.

**S** is for “**Science**” that can be used to backup our hypothesis. _(This can easily be swapped out e.g. “Societal benefit” for NPOs)_

**T** is for “**Technology**” required to implement change. _(A non-technical project might use “Training”)_.

**E** is for “**Engineering**” to build the MVP/MMF/prototype. _(Could be swapped e.g. for “Estimates”. Note: by all means estimate any costs incurred or resource types required, but not the time taken as cadence should be used instead)_.

**A** is for “**Automation**” required to make our tests repeatable and consistent. _(Could be swapped out on non-tech projects e.g. “Applied mathematics”)_

**M** is for “**Metrics**” used to measure success.


Note: the backronym **BRAINSTEAM**[2] is completely “open source” and can be adapted as required.
