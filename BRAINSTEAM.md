### BRAINSTEAM

A backronym developed for Lean startups[1], which can be easily adapted and used by any group developing an idea e.g. in a brainstorming session.

*B* is for the “Business opportunity”. (This can be swapped for “Basic premise” (e.g. for NPOs) or “Business requirement” in an Agile environment)

R is for any “Risks” that are to be managed or mitigated. (Planned for, insured against, avoided etc.)

A is for any “Assumptions” that are to be tested.

I is for any “Impediments” that need to be removed (or predicted ones that can be avoided).

N is for “Nudges” that can influence behaviour. See Nudge theory for detail.

S is for “Science” that can be used to backup our hypothesis. (This can easily be swapped out e.g. “Societal benefit” for NPOs)

T is for “Technology” required to implement change. (A non-technical project might use “Training”).

E is for “Engineering” to build the MVP/MMF/prototype. (Could be swapped e.g. for “Estimates”. Note: by all means estimate any costs incurred or resource types required, but not the time taken as cadence should be used instead).

A is for “Automation” required to make our tests repeatable and consistent. (Could be swapped out on non-tech projects e.g. “Applied mathematics”)

M is for “Metrics” used to measure success.


Note: the backronym BRAINSTEAM[2] is completely “open source” and can be adapted as required.
