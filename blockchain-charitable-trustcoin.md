# Blockchain Charitable Trustcoin ("BCT") 

### Purpose

* virtual currency used exlusively on a decentralised public ledger
* to hold value across international borders

#### Usage

* BCT would be a virtual currency on decentralised public ledger, meaning that no sovereign entity has overall control (i.e. no GCB)
* Non-fungible nature of a BCTs would give an unprecidented transparency to the use of charitable donations and international aid
* LXRs could be controlled by each GCB and reviewed periodically; this would be akin to them setting their GSC's base interest rate
* GCBs could lower the LXR to encourage charitable donations to be made in their territories 
* GCBs could raise the LXR to encourage foreign aid to be sent to their territories
* GCBs could hold a reserve of BCT in the ledger, in the same way that they might hold a reserve of physical assets (e.g. gold)
