## Phase 1
Create a new virtual currency "BCT" (Blockchain Charitable Trustcoin) used exclusively by governments for charitable causes, such as international humanitarian aid

* BTC would be a virtual currency on decentralised public ledger, meaning that no sovereign entity has overall control (i.e. no GCB)
* Non-fungible nature of a BTCs would give an unprecidented transparency to the use of charitable donations and international aid
* LXRs could be controlled by each GCB and reviewed periodically; this would be akin to them setting their LGC's base interest rate
* GCBs could lower the LXR to encourage charitable donations to be made in their territories 
* GCBs could raise the LXR to encourage foreign aid to be sent to their territories
* GCBs could hold a reserve of BCT in the ledger, in the same way that they might hold a reserve of physical assets (e.g. gold)
