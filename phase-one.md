## Phase 1

### Create "Blockchain Charitable Trustcoin" (virtual currency) and a suite of "Smart Contracts" 
_Note: initially these will be used exclusively by governments for charitable causes, such as international humanitarian aid_

#### Blockchain Charitable Trustcoin ("BTC")

* BTC would be a virtual currency on decentralised public ledger, meaning that no sovereign entity has overall control (i.e. no GCB)
* Non-fungible nature of a BTCs would give an unprecidented transparency to the use of charitable donations and international aid
* LXRs could be controlled by each GCB and reviewed periodically; this would be akin to them setting their LGC's base interest rate
* GCBs could lower the LXR to encourage charitable donations to be made in their territories 
* GCBs could raise the LXR to encourage foreign aid to be sent to their territories
* GCBs could hold a reserve of BCT in the ledger, in the same way that they might hold a reserve of physical assets (e.g. gold)

#### Smart Contracts 

* Any soverign entity will be able to create and close accounts
* Any GCB will be able to create and close accounts
* Any GCB will be able to create and destroy BTC (as they would for their local "real-world" currency) 

##### Accounts (can hold funds and containers)

* Open account (empty)
* Close account (must be empty)

##### Funds (can hold Trustcoins)

* Create fund (linked to a single account)
* Close fund (must be empty)

##### Trustcoins (generated by a GCB using LCG and the prevailing LXR)

* Deposit Trustcoins (into a single fund) 
* Transfer Trustcoins (from one fund to another \[in any account\])
* Withdraw Trustcoins (from a single fund)

* Distribute coins (one to many funds - single account)
* Amalgamate coins (many to one funds - single account)

##### Location (can be a single geographic location, or any form of "real-world" transportation)

* Create location 

##### Containers (can hold assets and are tokens for "read-world" containers i.e. anything that can be sealed & transported)

* Create container (single account, single location) 
* Transfer container (from one account to another) # Note: "real-world" logistics will determine the status of any transfer
* Update container location (single container)
* Retire container (must be empty)


##### Assets

* Deposit assets (into a single container) # Note: these are tokens for "real-world" assets
* Withdraw assets (from a single container)

* Distribute assets (from one to many containers - single account)
* Amalgamate assets (many to one container - single account)

#### _Key_

* _BTC - Blockchain Charitable Trustcoin_
* _GCB - Government Central Bank_
* _GSC - Government's Soverign Currency [as used locally for Legal Tender]_
* _LXR - Local exchange rate [i.e. the amount of GSC that is equivalent to a single BTC]_

### Develop website to enable tracking of BTC lifecycle and Asset transfer across a distributed public ledger
