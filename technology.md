# Technology used by The Blockchain Charitable Trust

## Open source

### GitHub
https://github.com/RobertBarrow/The-Blockchain-Charitable-Trust

All code will be open source and made available via the GitHub source code repository.
Documentation is created in plain text ASCII using GFM (GitHub Flavoured Markdown) for simple formatting.

## IPFS 
https://ipfs.io

Data files will be stored in IPFS swarms.  Links to IPFS records will be stored within blockchain transactions. 
This timestamps and secures our content, without having to put all of the data on the chain itself.

## Blockchain
https://www.blockchain.com

All transactions and record keeping audits will be created on a distributed public ledger, using Blockchain technology.

## Ethereum
https://www.ethereum.org

All transactions and record keeping audits will be executed via Smart Contracts, using the Ethereum platform.

### Open collective
https://opencollective.com

The intention is to form an "Open Collective" to accept donations and pay expenses during the initial development work.
*Note: this cannot be done until the GitHub Repo receives 100 stars*
