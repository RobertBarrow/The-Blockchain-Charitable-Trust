#### Testing at scale

### Pre-requisites

abilty to develop and quickly deploy a simple website with a single form and capture submits in a timestamped log file

e.g.

Full name:

Office / department:

email address:

Contact telephone no. 



### Funding

free hosting \(developer licences and free trials really help to keep down the costs\)

participation incentive \(depends on number of participants, and any other costa involved, but set a ceiling of £100\)



### Proof of concept

internal email inviting colleagues to participate in a simple website test, which should only take a few minutes

incentivise by stating that one “lucky“ participant will receive a prize \(e.g. £100\) for their time

if you have already prepared the website and are confident that it can be deployed / taken down quickly then you can also state the exact date and time of your test e.g. 12:00 noon \(GMT\) this Wednesday

make it clear that the website will only be up for a few minutes, so particpants should go onto the site just before this time to ensure that they have the chance to participate
